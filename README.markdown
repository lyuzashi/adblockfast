# ![Adblock Fast](assets/promo/adblockfast.png)

*The world’s fastest ad blocker! Same ad blocking, faster webpage loading.*

Just as webpages grew bloated with ads, so too have ad blockers grown bloated
with little-used filtering rules and features that hog your computer or device’s
disk space, CPU cycles, and memory. Adblock Fast runs a mere 7 optimized
filtering rules to block more than 80% of the ads but consume less than 20% of
the system resources that other ad blockers do.

Exactly how much faster, you ask, is Adblock Fast compared with those other ad
blockers? Let’s take a gander.

### Adblock Fast runs 6,963x fewer filtering rules per page.

* AdBlock: 48,746 rules
* Adblock Plus: 48,746 rules
* **Adblock Fast: 7 rules**

I.e., pages load faster.

### Adblock Fast consumes <em>n</em>x less kilobytes of disk.

* AdBlock: <em>n</em> KB
* Adblock Plus: <em>n</em> KB
* **Adblock Fast: <em>n</em> KB**

I.e., the app installs faster.

### Adblock Fast consumes a <em>n</em>x lower percentage of CPU.

* AdBlock: <em>n</em>%
* Adblock Plus: <em>n</em>%
* **Adblock Fast: <em>n</em>%**

I.e., other apps run faster.

### Adblock Fast consumes <em>n</em>x less megabytes of memory.

* AdBlock: <em>n</em> MB
* Adblock Plus: <em>n</em> MB
* **Adblock Fast: <em>n</em> MB**

I.e., other apps run faster still.

### Adblock Fast has ∞x fewer users to support.

* AdBlock: 10,000,000+ users
* Adblock Plus: 10,000,000+ users
* **Adblock Fast: 0 users**

I.e., we reply to email faster

## Owner’s manual

Adblock Fast is so fast that even reading the effing manual takes no time flat.
Here’s everything you need to know:

### In Chrome or Opera

Adblock Fast installs a button in your browser’s toolbar. The button indicates
the status of the site and page that you’re on:

![Blocked ads](opera/chrome/images/blocked-ads.png) Ads are being blocked on the
site and ads were found on the page.

![Blocked](opera/chrome/images/blocked.png) Ads are being blocked on the site,
but no ads were found on the page.

![Unblocked ads](opera/chrome/images/unblocked-ads.png) Ads aren’t being blocked
on the site, but ads were found on the page.

![Unblocked](opera/chrome/images/unblocked.png) Ads aren’t being blocked on the
site and no ads were found on the page.

If Adblock Fast is interfering with the behavior of the page (or if you’re a
masochist), you can click the button to unblock ads. Your setting will be
remembered whenever you go back to the site.

### In iOS

Adblock Fast blocks ads in Safari not in other apps. To allow Adblock Fast to
block in Safari:

1. press the Home button on your iPhone or iPad,
2. tap the **Settings** app,
3. tap **Safari** > (under <small>GENERAL</small>) **Content Blockers**, then
4. toggle the **Adblock Fast** switch on.

To unblock ads, navigate to the **Adblock Fast** app.

## Questions (possibly to be asked frequently)

### Who created Adblock Fast<em>?</em>

Adblock Fast was created and is maintained by
[Rocketship](http://rocketshipapps.com/), an award-winning app studio based in
Palo Alto and San Francisco. Our aim is to design and develop only the finest
mobile and web experiences, of our own and for clients.

### Where is Adblock Fast’s filtering ruleset from<em>?</em>

Adblock Fast’s filtering ruleset is derived from
[EasyList](https://easylist.adblockplus.org/en/) and that of
[Bluhell Firewall](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-Us/firefox/addon/bluhell-firewall/).
We’re also testing a new, alternative ruleset that we expect to improve ad
blocking yet another order of magnitude.

### How does Adblock Fast make money<em>?</em>

Adblock Fast doesn’t, nor do we intend for Adblock Fast to ever, make any money.
We operate an ([aforementioned](#who-created-adblock-fast)) app studio that’s
bootstrapped and quite profitable. Yesterday, you probably didn’t know we
existed. Today, you do and, someday, perhaps you’ll be creating the next killer
app and will consider hiring us. (Hmm, maybe doing good work and shipping good
products ought to replace advertising<em>!</em>) Unlike
[other ad blockers](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/06/google-and-others-reportedly-pay-adblock-plus-to-show-you-ads-anyway/),
we don’t have to sell out to support our project.
