*The world’s fastest ad blocker! Same ad blocking, faster webpage loading.*

with little-used filtering rules and features that hog your computer or device’s
disk space, CPU cycles, and memory. Adblock Fast runs a mere 7 optimized
filtering rules to block more than 80% of the ads but consume less than 20% of
