<h1>Stuff is about to get a whole lot faster<em>!</em></h1>
<h2>
  Adblock Fast is so fast that even reading the effing manual takes no time
  flat. Here’s everything you need to know.
</h2>
<p>
  Adblock Fast just installed a button in your browser’s toolbar. The button
  will indicate the status of each site and page that you go to from now on:
</p>
<ul>
  <li id="blocked-ads">
    Ads are being blocked on the site and ads were found on the page.
  </li>
  <li id="blocked">
    Ads are being blocked on the site, but no ads were found on the page.
  </li>
  <li id="unblocked-ads">
    Ads aren’t being blocked on the site, but ads were found on the page.
  </li>
  <li id="unblocked">
    Ads aren’t being blocked on the site and no ads were found on the page.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If Adblock Fast interferes with the behavior of the page, you can click the
  button to unblock ads. Your setting will be remembered whenever you’re on the
  site again.
