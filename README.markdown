# ![Adblock Fast](assets/promo/adblockfast.png)

*The world’s fastest ad blocker! Same ad blocking, faster webpage loading.*

Just as webpages grew bloated with ads, so too have ad blockers grown bloated
with little-used filtering rules and features that hog your computer or device’s
disk space, CPU cycles, and memory. Adblock Fast runs a mere 7 optimized
filtering rules to block more than 80% of the ads but consume less than 20% of
the system resources that other ad blockers do.

## Owner’s manual

Adblock Fast is so fast that even reading the effing manual takes no time flat.
Here’s everything you need to know:

### In Chrome or Opera

Adblock Fast installs a button in your browser’s toolbar. The button indicates
the status of the site and page that you’re on:

![Blocked ads](opera/chrome/images/blocked-ads.png) Ads are being blocked on the
site and ads were found on the page.

![Blocked](opera/chrome/images/blocked.png) Ads are being blocked on the site,
but no ads were found on the page.

![Unblocked ads](opera/chrome/images/unblocked-ads.png) Ads aren’t being blocked
on the site, but ads were found on the page.

![Unblocked](opera/chrome/images/unblocked.png) Ads aren’t being blocked on the
site and no ads were found on the page.

If Adblock Fast is interfering with the behavior of the page (or if you’re a
masochist), you can click the button to unblock ads. Your setting will be
remembered whenever you go back to the site.

### In iOS

Adblock Fast blocks ads in Safari not in other apps. To allow Adblock Fast to
block in Safari:

1. press the Home button on your iPhone or iPad,
2. tap the **Settings** app,
3. tap **Safari** > (under <small>GENERAL</small>) **Content Blockers**, then
4. toggle the **Adblock Fast** switch on.

To unblock ads, navigate to the **Adblock Fast** app.
